# arduino-puzzles
This repository contains documentation and schematics for puzzles in The Locked Room, a real-life escape room built into a shipping container.
Firmware for each puzzle is in the relevant directory as Arduino sketches.

## Room Wiring:
The following diagram shows how each of the puzzles are wired together in the room.
A [PDF version](https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkHedleyJones/arduino-puzzles/be08f4e4/images/layout/full-layout.pdf) of the diagram is also available.
Lengths of CAT5 cable are used to link puzzles the puzzles to the main controller in a star configuration.
The communication bus between the main controller and each puzzle is I2C.

### Puzzle_MorseCodePhone
This device generates a morse code tone sequence and playes it on the phone in the room.
It has the ability to ring the phone by applying the required waveform to the solenoid driven bell system.
